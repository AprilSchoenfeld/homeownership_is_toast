# homeownership_is_toast

# We are comparing the median list price of a Manhattan apartment by zip code to the price of avocados. 

# We pulled real estate data by zip from Realtor.com & avocado prices from Kaggle - which is compiled from the Haas Avocado Board. 

# We were inspired by Tim Gurner, an Australian Millionaire, who infamously claimed millennials can't afford to buy their first home because they are spending too much money on frivolous purchases, like avocado toast.

# So, we wanted to see how many avocados an average home in the city would cost.
